    Good morning heads.
    If you are reading this, it means that the launch of the station was successful and you have already arrived at your workplace as part of an early group. If not, this document will be waiting for your arrival at the transport shuttle.

    We congratulate you on the start of work in our pilot project. The purpose of this station is to study the prospects for the long-term functioning of scientific stations as autonomous objects. Therefore, you, as heads, are given full carte blanche to develop, refine and organize the activities of your departments and station compartments.

    You are expected to:
    - Initiative development of various approaches to personnel management.
    - Technical modification of the station entrusted to you at your discretion.
    - Equipping your departments with modern equipment.

    Statistical data collected from stations of your type will be transferred to NanoTrasen's analytics department for further study. Experiment and show your leadership qualities, your initiative and creativity - that's what we need.

    We are proud of you, and remember: humanity is with us.

    P.S: The Human Resources department is having difficulty recruiting qualified staff, so we have resorted to emergency measures. If you find a possible traitor or an employee whose knowledge does not correspond to his position, act according to the situation.

    P.P.S: Expect possible additional tasks. If they appear, we will get in touch with you.
